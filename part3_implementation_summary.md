## Implementation Details

### Environment Adaptation

The `rocket_env.py` file was modified to:
- Support the 'starship' rocket type parameter (defaulting to it)
- Maintain compatibility with the Gymnasium API
- Properly handle observation and action spaces
- Support rendering for visualization

### Training Approach

The training process in `train_sb3.py`:
- Uses PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm from Stable-Baselines3
- Normalizes observations and rewards for faster, more stable learning
- Implements callbacks for regular model checkpointing
- Includes evaluation during training to track progress
- Saves visualization of training metrics

### Model Testing and Evaluation

The `test_trained_model.py` script:
- Loads a trained model (final model or the latest checkpoint)
- Visualizes the model's performance in human-viewable episodes
- Calculates landing success rate and mean rewards
- Performs a more extensive evaluation (20 episodes) for statistical significance
- Saves results to a text file for analysis

### Reward Improvement Analysis

The `reward_improvement_ideas.md` document analyzes the current reward function and proposes several improvements:
1. Distance-based reward shaping with exponential scaling
2. Velocity matching rewards for controlled descent
3. Terminal position precision bonuses
4. Fuel efficiency components
5. Trajectory smoothness rewards
6. Hoverslam (suicide burn) encouragement
7. Adaptive reward scaling based on training progress

## Running the Implementation

1. **Install requirements:**
   ```
   pip install -r sb3_requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Train the model:**
   ```
   python train_sb3.py
   ```
   This will train for approximately 5M timesteps and save results to `sb3_rocket_logs/` and models to `sb3_rocket_models/`.

3. **Test a trained model:**
   ```
   python test_trained_model.py
   ```
   This will load the trained model and visualize its performance.

## Results and Analysis

The training process produces several artifacts:
- Learning curves showing reward improvement over time
- Model checkpoints at regular intervals
- Final trained model
- Evaluation metrics including success rate and mean rewards

These results allow us to analyze the effectiveness of the PPO algorithm on the rocket landing task and identify areas for further improvement.

## Future Directions

Based on the reward improvement analysis, future work could focus on:
- Implementing the proposed reward function enhancements
- Comparing performance across different algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C)
- Applying curriculum learning to gradually increase landing difficulty
- Training with different rocket types and comparing performance
